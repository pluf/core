/**
 * Repositories are object or components that encapsulate the logic required to access data sources.
 *
 * They centralize common data access functionality, providing better maintainability and decoupling the
 * infrastructure or technology used to access databases from the domain model layer. If you use an
 * Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) like Entity Framework, the code that must be implemented is simplified.
 * This lets you focus on the data persistence logic rather than on data access plumbing.
 *
 * The Repository pattern is a well-documented way of working with a data source. In the book Patterns
 * of Enterprise Application Architecture, Martin Fowler describes a repository as follows:
 *
 * A repository performs the tasks of an intermediary between the domain model layers and data mapping, acting
 * in a similar way to a set of domain objects in memory. Client objects declaratively build queries and send
 * them to the repositories for answers. Conceptually, a repository encapsulates a set of objects stored in
 * the database and operations that can be performed on them, providing a way that is closer to the persistence
 * layer. Repositories, also, support the purpose of separating, clearly and in one direction, the dependency
 * between the work domain and the data allocation or mapping.
 *
 * Basically, a repository allows you to populate data in memory that comes from the database in the form of the
 * domain entities. Once the entities are in memory, they can be changed and then persisted back to the
 * database through transaction.

    /**
     * Defines one repository per aggregate
     *
     * For each aggregate or aggregate root, you should create one repository object. In a microservice based on
     * Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns, the only channel you should use to update the database should be the
     * repositories. This is because they have a one-to-one relationship with the aggregate root, which controls
     * the aggregate’s invariants and transactional consistency. It's okay to query the database through other
     * channels (as you can do following a CQRS approach), because queries don't change the state of the database.
     * However, the transactional area (that is, the updates) must always be controlled by the repositories and
     * the aggregate roots.
     *
     * It can be valuable to create your repository in such a way that it enforces the rule that only
     * aggregate roots should have repositories. This utility functions create new instance of such a repository
     * for a given $modelType. Forexample:
     *
     * $repo = Repository::getInstance(Book::class);
     *
     * Creates a repository to mange Books.
